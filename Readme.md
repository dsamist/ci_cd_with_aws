## CI/CD with AWS

The aim of this project is to build a CI/CD pipeline using AWS. 

The project is inspired from the walkthrough found on the AWS website [aws_ci_cd](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-continuous-delivery-pipeline/).

The tools needed to finish and set this up are:

    1. A github account

    2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk: This is a service offered by AWS that helps simplifies the deployment and scaling of web applications. It is easy to use and has preconfigirations (underlying libraries and infrastructures) that fits your application codes.

    3. AWS CodeBuild: This is also a service provided by aws that simplifies the building and testing process of your application code.

    4. AWS CodePipeline: Another service also provided by aws that automate the process of releasing software into the AWS cloud.

The application used for this learning is gotten from github [aws-elastic-beanstalk](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample)
